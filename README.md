# Questionnaire Star

A simple questionnaire application that allows users to create and answer questionnaires.

Creators:
- Axel Gleisner
- Houwan Liu
- Linjing Shen
- Ella Taawo

Houwan Liu and Linjing Shen worked as a team for most of the project, while Axel Gleisner and Ella Taawo worked individually.

## Admin view

Every user can create questionnaires and share them with others. Only the creator can view the results of their questionnaires. This view is accessible by clicking on the "Results" button in the questionnaire list. By the time of submission of this project, the results screen is not yet fully implemented.
